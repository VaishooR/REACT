SLICE vs SPLICE:
---------------

Slice and splice are methods used on JavaScript arrays to retrieve certain elements or remove elements from the array.
If you have to alter the content of the array, splice is the way to go, but if you just want to obtain a subarray, slice should be your choice.


--------------------------
slice --> returns a piece of the array but it doesn’t affect the original array. 
splice --> changes the original array by removing, replacing, or adding values and returns the affected values.

slice - means cut into pices
splice - means to join things together


--------------------------
SLICE:
Syntax:
array.slice(start, end)

start denotes the index at which the array starts slicing.
end denotes the index at which the array stops slicing.

The returned value of the slice method is an array of the values found between start and end excluding the value at end.

If end is not specified, the length of the array would be used. Hence, all values from the start index would be returned.

It returns a piece of the array but it doesn’t affect the original array.

----------------------------
SPLICE:
Syntax
array.splice(start, deleteCount, newElem1, newElem2, ..., newElemN);

start denotes the index from which the method will start its operation on the array.
deleteCount denotes the number of values to be deleted from the start. If the value is 0, nothing will be deleted.
newElem1 to newElemN denote the values that would be added after the start.
